  Always pull updates to avoid conflicts.

- **Clear Commit Messages:**  
  Use descriptive messages like "Add user login feature" instead of vague ones.

- **Use .gitignore:**  
  Exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`) from version control.

- **Backup with Stash:**  
  Use `git stash` to save work-in-progress before switching branches.
